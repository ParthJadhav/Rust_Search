Blazingly fast file search library built in Rust ðŸ”¥ [Work in progress]

[![Version info](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rust_search.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rust_search)

## Usage

Please report any problems you encounter when using rust search here: [Issues](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/rust_search/issues)

Add `rust_search = "0.1.4"` in Cargo.toml.

```toml
[dependencies]
rust_search = "0.1.4"
```

Then, use it in your code:

```rust
use rust_search::Search;

fn main(){
    let depth = 1;

    let search = Search::new("/path/to/directory", Some("fileName"), Some(".fileExtension"), Some(depth));

    for path in search {
        println!("{}", path);
    }
}
```

To get all the files with a specific extension in a directory, use:

```rust
use rust_search::Search;

Search::new("/path/to/directory", None, Some(".fileExtension"), Some(1));
```

To get all the files in a directory, use:

```rust
use rust_search::Search;

Search::new("/path/to/directory", None, None, Some(1));
```
